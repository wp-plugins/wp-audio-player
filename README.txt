WP Audio Player is a plugin based on the popular player from the guys at Codrops that aims to make it easy to include an audio player in your post.

== Description ==

WP Audio Player is a plugin that brings the <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/12/04/responsive-touch-friendly-audio-player/">Responsive and Touch-Friendly Audio Player</a> from Codrops to WordPress.

It introduces a meta box to each post page that allows you to supply the URL to any audio file and will then append the player to the end of the post. This way, you're able to upload your media using the built in Media Uploader, and then use the provided URL to add the player to your post.

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' Plugin Dashboard
2. Select `wp-audio-player.zip` from your computer
3. Upload
4. Activate the plugin on the WordPress Plugin Dashboard

= Using FTP =

1. Extract `wp-audio-player.zip` to your computer
2. Upload the `wp-audio-player` directory to your `wp-content/plugins` directory
3. Activate the plugin on the WordPress Plugins dashboard

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Right now, the player only appears at the bottom of the post. Can I change it's position? =

In version 1.0, no; however, this is a planned feature assuming that the plugin is useful for other people.

== Screenshots ==

1. WP Audio Player running in Chrome.

2. WP Audio Player running in fallback mode in Firefox.

3. WP Audio Player rendering in responsive mode.

4. A screenshot of the updated dashboard for how you can retrieve MP3's from your media library.
